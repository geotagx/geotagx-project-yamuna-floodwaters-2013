<p>In this question you are looking for signs that protective measures have been put up against the floods. This can include temporary measures like sandbags (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbags">what are sandbags?</a>), or makeshift barriers, and permanent measures like embankments. An embankment is a man-made hill running along the river bank that raises the level of the river bank and so stops water from flooding surrounding areas when it rises. An embankment could be made from a variety of materials including concrete and soil (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee">what is an embankment?</a>). See the photos below for examples of different flood protection measures.</p>
