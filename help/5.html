<p>Fast moving flood waters are dangerous. They can wash away people and property and make crossing the river near impossible.</p>
<p>Fast moving water can be identified by the following indicators:</p>
<ul>
	<li>White peaks in the water and rough surface &ndash; fast moving water can form waves on the surface, which are indicated by the white peaks and rough, choppy water surface.</li>
	<li>Water swirling around objects &ndash; As fast moving water hits objects in its path such as buildings, trees, poles, and vehicles, it will rise up around them.</li>
</ul>
